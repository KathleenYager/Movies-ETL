# Movies-ETL

## Purpose:
The Movies-ETL project uses datasets extracted from the internet as a source for data analysis. 

## Method: 
Data from Wiki and Kaggle datasets was cleaned, transformed, merged and uploaded to SQL for analysis. A ratings file was added to the merged movie file. The movie file has 6,051 rows of data and the ratings file includes 26,024,289 rows of data. 

This cleaned data source will provide a significant resource to perform data analysis. 

## Summary: 
Data uploaded to SQL is substantial and allow data analysts a tool to determine budget size for movies included in the dataset, when movies were made, who produced, directed and composed the movie.
